# Code for beautiful graphs
This repository has various R scripts with code that I've written to make beautiful graphs! Each script includes an example dataset so you can see how the code works and the resulting graph. 


## corset_plots.R
This is code that I wrote to make faceted corset plots (see Leib et al., accepted, Dev Psych)

The original data set looked at performance on two different trial types (congruent vs incongruent) for participants in different grades (Grade 3, 5, and 7). However, this code could be used anytime a participant has two data points in a sample (e.g., pre and post-test) and you want to plot the change between that for individual participants, and at a group level.
